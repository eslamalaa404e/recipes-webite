  <p>Creamy and incredibly savory, it's a casserole that's hard to stop eating. The cottage cheese is the trick to getting such a creamy, melty texture. Using rotisserie chicken is a must for the recipe and helps keep it quick.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can cream of chicken soup</li>
  <li>1 cup cottage cheese</li>
  <li>½ cup sour cream</li>

  <li>1 ½ teaspoons Creole seasoning</li>
  <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder, divided</li>
  <li>5 cups shredded rotisserie chicken</li>
  <li>1 cup finely chopped yellow onion</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
  <li>30 buttery round crackers (such as Ritz®), crushed</li>
  <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
  <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon sliced scallions, or to taste</li>
</ul>
